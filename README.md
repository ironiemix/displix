displix client scripts
======================

These scripts are helper scripts to create a digital signage system with a raspberry pi. 
It needs a raspbian installation with i3-wm and midori to work. It's intended to be used with 
the displixian raspi image you cat get from linuxmuster.net. (FIXME Link)
